          <p>Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 
            in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly Catholic province 
            of North Brabant in the Netherlands

            he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen,
             where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home

            his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, 
            where he was also deeply unhappy.[34] His interest in art began at a young age.
            He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother,
            and his early drawings are expressive,
            but do not approach the intensity of his later work.
            Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, 
            taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject 
            technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. 
            Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect.

            he took up a post as a missionary at Petit-Wasmes
             in the working class, coal-mining district of Borinage in Belgium. 
             To show support for his impoverished congregation, he gave up his comfortable 
             lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut, where he slept on straw.
            His humble living conditions did not endear him to church authorities, who dismissed him 
            for "undermining the dignity of the priesthood". He then walked the 75 kilometres 
            to Brussels,[54] returned briefly to Cuesmes in the Borinage, but he 
            gave in to pressure from his parents to return home to Etten.

            Van Gogh returned to Cuesmes in August 1880, 
            where he lodged with a miner until October.
            He became interested in the people and scenes around him,
            and he recorded them in drawings after Theo's suggestion that he take up art in earnest.
            He traveled to Brussels later in the year,
            to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, 
            who persuaded him  in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art 
            to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts.

            Van Gogh returned to Etten in April 1881 for an extended stay with his parents.
            He continued to draw, often using his neighbours as subjects

            In September 1883, Van Gogh moved to Drenthe in the northern Netherlands.
             In December driven by loneliness, he went to live with his parents, then in Nuenen,

            Van Gogh painted several groups of still lifes in 1885.
            During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he completed numerous drawings and watercolours and nearly 200 oil paintings. 
            His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones,
             particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colours that distinguished his later work.

            Van Gogh moved to Paris in March 1886 where he shared Theo's rue Laval apartment
             in Montmartre and studied at Fernand Cormon's studio. In June the brothers took a 
             larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. In Paris, Vincent painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, 
            still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asnières and along the Seine.

            In March 1888 he painted landscapes using a gridded "perspective frame"; 
            three of the works were shown at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes 
            Indépendants. In April, he was visited by the American artist Dodge MacKnight,
            who was living nearby at Fontvieille. On 1 May 1888, for 15 francs per month,
            he signed a lease for the eastern wing of the Yellow House at 2 place Lamartine. The rooms
            were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months.

            Van Gogh entered the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum on 8 May 1889, 
            accompanied by his caregiver, Frédéric Salles, a Protestant clergyman. 
            Saint-Paul was a former monastery in Saint-Rémy, located less than 30 kilometres
          19 mi) from Arles, and it was run by a former naval doctor, Théophile Peyron.
          Van Gogh had two cells with barred windows, one of which he used as a studio.
          The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of his paintings.

            On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh is believed to have shot himself in the chest with a 
            7 mm Lefaucheux pinfire revolver.[203][204] There were no witnesses and he died 30 hours 
            after the incident.[174] The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which 
            he had been painting, or in a local barn.The bullet was deflected by a rib
             and passed through his chest without doing apparent damage to internal organs  probably stopped by his spine.
